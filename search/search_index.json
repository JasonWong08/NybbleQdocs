It's a new breed of robotic cat that everyone can learn and play with. The small but mighty Nybble Q has these fantastic features: Respond to voice commands, performing over 35 predefined actions such as sit, push-up, and wash-face with high-performance, lifelike movements. You can switch between English and Chinese using simple voice commands. It can be programmed with ten more customized voice commands performing skills you create. The voice command can be any sound, so it's free from languages . Support Petoi Coding Blocks(block-based Scratch-like), C++, and Python . Free C++ and Petoi Coding Blocks (block-based Scratch-like) curriculums . Equipped with BiBoard V1, a high-performance ESP32 development board supporting additional modules for robotics/AI/IoT applications. If you have questions about why rather than how , please post on our forum at https://www.petoi.com/forum or write to support@petoi.com . There are some supporting applications, software , and FAQs for your reference. You can support us by shopping at www.petoi.com/store .
